# Shangri-la_Petition

Citizens in the Valley of Shangri-La now have a new way to shape parliamentary discussion through the
Shangri-La Petition Platform (SLPP). This platform allows citizens of Shangri-La to create or sign petitions
on matter within the governmentâ€™s responsibility. Any citizen can propose a petition on topics they care about.
Once a petition reaches the signature threshold set by the Petitions Committee, it then qualifies for
parliamentary debate. After the debate, the Petitions Committee issues a summary response of behalf of the
Parliament before formally closing the petition. Your task is to design and implement the SLPP, which can be
developed as either an app or a website.
